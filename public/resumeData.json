    "bio": "Hello! My name is Agustín Gregorieu and I'm an Information Systems Engineer who likes traveling, I'm looking for jobs abroad related to the software development. I have worked exclusively on projects oriented towards the web environment. I have experience using several tools as you will be able to appreciate in the ''skills'' section, most of them related to Web Development. \n I have the need to emphasize that although I'm young and I have lack of experience in some technologies, I'm a very quick and enthusiastic learner. I consider myself to be a proactive and analytical person. I'm fully dedicated to the service, and I'm highly interested in learning and updating my knowledge about the market’s new tendencies and new technologies.",
